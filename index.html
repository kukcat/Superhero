    <div>
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that normal person
            couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a
                normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise
            a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p>

        <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or
            human-interest story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
            superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't
            accomplish, then i assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
